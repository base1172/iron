Iron is Jane Street's internal code review tool.

For more on the design of iron, see the following blog posts:

A key design decision was to review diffs rather than patches:

- https://blog.janestreet.com/patch-review-vs-diff-review-revisited/

We no longer release the code of Iron, and do not expect that will change.
It was never possible to run outside of Jane Street, and is not plausible
that it ever will, due to dependencies on many aspects of our internal
environment.
